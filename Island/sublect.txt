Write a C program that takes a file as an argument. The file contains a rectangular map made up of:
'.' for water
'X' for land.

The program must:
Parse and validate the map.
Find the size of the largest island (connected 'X' characters) or the total number of islands.

Islands:
An island is defined as 'X' characters connected horizontally or vertically (no diagonal connections).
Validation:

The map must only contain '.', 'X', and '\n'.
All rows must be the same length.
The file must not be empty or contain empty lines.

Allowed functions: write, read, mmap, fstat, open, close, munmap, malloc, free.

Output: Print the size of the largest island and the total number of islands.
